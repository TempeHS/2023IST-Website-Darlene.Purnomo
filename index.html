<H1>Hello World and fellow otters!</H1>
<H3>I am an otter staying at Toba Aquarium (in Japan) which is a public aquarium! Lots of people come and visit me while I chill in the ice cold waters.</H3>
<p>Here is the link to my aquarium website if you want to know how you can visit me</P>

<p>This is me and my younger bro. He doesn't know how to float on water yet.</P>

<H3>A surprise</H3>
<p>I think that a lot of you guys don't know otters use the Internet underwater. One day on Youtube, I found footage of myself! Here's the video:</P>

<H3>Here are some facts about us otters:</H3>
<p>ðŸ¦ªWe have to hold hands when we sleep otherwise we float away from each other on the water</P>
<p>ðŸ¦ªWe can eat an amount of up to 25 per cent of our body weight in food each day because we love eating</P>
<p>ðŸ¦ªTo eat clams, we use rocks to smash them open</P>
<p>ðŸ¦ªWe often cover our eyes with our paws to help us sleep during the day</P>
<p>ðŸ¦ªOn 'World Otter Records', the longest dive ever recorded was just under 8 minutes.</P>
