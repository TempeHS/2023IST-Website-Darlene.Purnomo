<H1>Hello World and fellow otters!</H1>
<H3>I am an otter staying at Toba Aquarium (in Japan) which is a public aquarium! If you don't know what that means... it means that lots of hoomans come and visit me.</H3>

<p>This is me and my younger bro. He doesn't know how to float on water yet.</P>

<p>I think that a lot of you guys don't know otters use the Internet underwater. One day, on Youtube, I found footage of myself!</P>

<p>I was very confused</P>

<H3>Here are some facts about us otters:</H3>
<p>We have to hold hands when we sleep otherwise we float away from each other on the water</P>
<p>We can eat an amount of up to 25 per cent of our body weight in food each day because we love eating</P>
<p>To eat clams, we use rocks to smash them open</P>
