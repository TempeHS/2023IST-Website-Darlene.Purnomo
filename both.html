      <h4 id="list-item-1">Habits to practise</h4>
      <p>If you want to fall asleep faster, there have been many studies which prove these habits will reduce the time taken to fall asleep. These habits are known as sleep hygiene. <br> 
	  <br> </br>
	    Sticking to a consistent sleep and wake schedule <br>
		Reducing caffeine and alcohol intake <br>
		Avoiding electronic devices in the leadup to bedtime <br>
		Ensuring that you have a quiet, dark, and comfortably cool sleep environment free of distractions <br>
		Keeping naps to 30 minutes or less and not too close to bedtime <br>
		Choosing appropriate bedtime snacks - find out which ones they are on our <a style="color:#95B8D1;" href="sites.html">sites</a> page</p>
      <h4 id="list-item-2">Meditation</h4>
      <p>By relaxing your body and brain, it’s easier to quiet the distracting thoughts that keep your mind buzzing. Studies have found that meditation can help reduce cortisol, which is the hormone associated with stress. Meditation increases the natural melatonin levels to help with more restful sleep. Furthermore, meditation is shown to have benefits on patients with mental health disorders who may experience insomnia as a symptom. By using meditation to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, some patients have an easier time falling and staying asleep.</p>
      <h4 id="list-item-3">Music</h4>
      <p>A noisy setting can make it difficult to quickly achieve restful sleep. In addition to reducing any unnecessary or bothersome sounds, you may find that listening to soothing music helps you relax and block out external noises. Consider preparing a playlist that aligns with an ideal 15 to 20 minute sleep latency window and listen each night to create a routine for yourself. If you find music too distracting, some people also tout the benefits of white noise for sleep.</p>
      <h4 id="list-item-4">Military Method</h4>
      <p>Members of the military often have inconsistent schedules and less-than-optimal sleeping conditions, which can affect their sleep patterns Trusted Source National Library of Medicine, Biotech Information The National Center for Biotechnology Information advances science and health by providing access to biomedical and genomic information. View Source . <br>
	  <br> </br>
	  The military method is a technique developed to help soldiers achieve sleep in two minutes. This process includes the following steps: Assume a comfortable position and relax each part of your face, such as your eyelids, jaw, lips, and brow. Allow your arms to rest at your sides, dropping your shoulders first. <br>
	  <br> </br> 
	  Begin taking deep breaths to relax your chest. Start relaxing your lower half, working your way from your hips down through each part of your leg to your feet. Visualize a peaceful setting to set your mind at ease, such as beautiful countryside, a quiet lake, or a cozy room in your home. If you experience any intrusive thoughts, recognize them and try to move beyond these images. Visualization might be a bit difficult — if you struggle to conjure relaxing images, repeat a simple phrase to yourself, like “don’t think.”</p>
      <h4 id="list-item-1">Making a daily schedule</h4>
      <p>This step is absolutely crucial for learning how to manage time at work. Don’t even attempt starting your day without an organized to-do list. Before you leave work for the day, create a list of the most pressing tasks for the next day. This step allows you to get going as soon as you get to the office. Putting everything on paper will prevent you from lying awake at night tossing and turning over the tasks running through your brain. Instead, your subconscious goes to work on your plans while you are asleep, which means you can wake up in the morning with new insights for the workday. If you can’t do it the day before, make sure you write out your list first thing in the morning. You’ll find that the time you spend creating a clear plan is nothing compared to the time you’ll lose jumping between tasks when you lack such a plan.</p>
      <h4 id="list-item-2">Stop procrastination</h4>
      <p>Procrastination is often confused with laziness, but they are very different. Procrastination is an active process – you choose to do something else instead of the task that you know you should be doing. In contrast, laziness suggests apathy, inactivity and an unwillingness to act. Procrastination usually involves ignoring an unpleasant, but likely more important task, in favor of one that is more enjoyable or easier. But giving in to this impulse can have serious consequences. For example, even minor episodes of procrastination can make us feel guilty or ashamed. It can lead to reduced productivity and cause us to miss out on achieving our goals. If we procrastinate over a long period of time, we can become demotivated and disillusioned with our work, which can lead to depression and even job loss, in extreme cases.</p>
      <h4 id="list-item-3">Assign time limits to tasks</h4>
      <p>Part of creating your schedule should involve setting time limits on tasks instead of just working until they’re done. To-do lists are great and wonderful, but sometimes you might feel like you never check anything off. Create time limits for tasks and achieve them in that time period. You’ll find your productivity skyrocketing and your to-do list shrinking when you have these parameters in place.</p>
      <h4 id="list-item-4">Reward yourself</h4>
      <p>After succesfully completing your daily schedule, reward yourself! That could be getting a favourite food or watching something you enjoy.</p>
